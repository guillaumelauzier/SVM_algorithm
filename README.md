# SVM_algorithm

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Here is an example of how you could implement an SVM in C++

In this code, the predict function takes a vector of input features, x, and a vector of model weights, w, and returns the predicted outcome using the SVM model. The gradient function computes the gradient of the hinge loss with respect to the model weights, which is used in the gradient_descent function to learn the model.
